      <a href="/">Business Card Maker</a> allows you to easily create business cards in seconds, <strong>for free</strong>, using high quality professional designs, in your web browser without having to install any extra software.

      Just type in your contact details on the business card, add a logo or picture, and get a printable PDF that you can print at home or at your local printer, or a high quality picture that you can share on Facebook, or anywhere else online.
    </p>

    <p>
      You can order printed business cards by clicking the <a href="/"><strong>Cards starting at $9.99!</strong></a> button, bellow the business card.

      <em>For the best quality, print the PDF with the business cards on an A4 sized paper. </em> If you can't print on A4, you can use letter sized paper and the results should be similar.
    </p>

    <p>
      Once you've printed the PDF, you'll get 10 business cards on a page that you can then cut up.
    </p>

    <p>
      For the logo, try to use images with a large resolution, and transparent background, if possible.
